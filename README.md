# Venice Boat Classification using CNN

This project applies supervised learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
to classify boat images into multiple categories such as gondola, ferry boat, kayak, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:
Boat Types Recognition Dataset

The dataset is accessed programmatically using the Kaggle API
and is not included in this repository.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Kaggle API

## Model
A CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
was trained and evaluated using training and validation accuracy and loss metrics.

The trained model is saved as `venice_boat_cnn.h5` and can be downloaded by running the notebook.
